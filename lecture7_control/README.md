# Julia for Control

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XSY-l4tIMMo1ZvbO9H9_d20Q8VxoDItPPDa0cpbvKrI/edit?usp=sharing)

This weeks material is a mix of
- ControlSystems and ModelingToolkit
- How to control physical hardware


## Homework

### Step 1: Modeling
Pick a modeling tool of your choice, for example
- ControlSystems.jl
- ModelingToolkit.jl
- DifferentialEquations.jl
- RigidBodyDynamics.jl

and model a control problem (preferably related to your research or teaching).

### Step 2: Design and Analysis
Design a controller for the system using any method and tool you see fit. Perform some form of analysis on the design, such as
- Robustness analysis using ControlSystems or RobustAndOptimalControl
- Reachability analysis using REachabilityAnalysis.jl
- Monte-Carlo analysis
- Your own fancy method

Present the analysis using some nice figures.
