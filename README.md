## Previously under "upcoming"
### Lecture 1
Session on Tuesday 6/9 10:15-12:00 [Introduction](https://github.com/baggepinnen/juliacourse2022/tree/master/lecture1_intro).

In the first lecture we will discuss the course format and I'll give an introduction to Julia. In advance of this lecture, it would be great if you have installed Julia (using [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) or by [downloading the binary](https://julialang.org/downloads/)), and setup your editor of choice. If you are unsure what editor to use, I recommend using [vscode with julia support](https://www.julia-vscode.org/). Support for other editors can be found [here](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport).

*Homework*: Convert a script or function you have written in another language to julia. Test that it computes what you expect.
