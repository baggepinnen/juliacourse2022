## Why use Julia?
- Solves the two-language problem. From ThinkJulia.jl :
> Julia is a unique programming language because it solves
the so-called two languages problem. No other program-
ming language is needed to write high-performance code.
This does not mean it happens automatically. It is the re-
sponsability of the programmer to optimize the code that
forms a bottleneck but this can done in Julia itself.*

## Why use Julia?
- Open source and free: The whole language and all packages!
- Possible to understand what is going on, Julia is written in Julia!
- Easy to get started
- Many third party libraries (8000+, not as many as Python)
- Easy to make reproducible projects
- Fast and high level

## Why not use Julia?
#### For control
- Real-time performance
#### For industry
- Hire Julia programmers
- Deployment currently not straightforward
#### For academia
- Package ecosystem
