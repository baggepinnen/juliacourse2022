## Why use Julia?
- Solves the dual-language problem. From ThinkJulia.jl :
*Julia is a unique programming language because it solves
the so-called two languages problem. No other program-
ming language is needed to write high-performance code.
This does not mean it happens automatically. It is the re-
sponsability of the programmer to optimize the code that
forms a bottleneck but this can done in Julia itself.*

## Why use Julia?
- Open source and free: The whole language and all packages!
- Possible to understand what is going on, Julia is written in Julia!
- Easy to get started
- Many third party libraries (3000+, not as many as Python)
